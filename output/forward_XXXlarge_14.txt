Welcome to Feature Selection Algorithm.

Type in the name of the dataset to test:
CS170_XXXlarge_Data__14.txt

Type the number of the algorithm you want to run.
1. Forward Selection
2. Backward Elimination

This dataset has 80 features (not including the class attribute), with 4000 instances.

Please wait while I normalize the data ... Done!

Running nearest neighbor with no features (default rate), using "leaving-one-out" evaluation, I get an accuracy of 81.575%
